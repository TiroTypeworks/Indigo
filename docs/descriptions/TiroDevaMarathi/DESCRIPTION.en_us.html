    Tiro Devanagari Marathi has its origins in a typeface designed for the Murty Classical Library of India book series, so is especially suited to traditional literary publishing but also made with the needs of todayâ€™s multiple print and screen media in mind. The Tiro Devanagari design applies a contemporary approach to the traditional proportions and styling of types exemplified in the 20th Century metal types of the renowned Nirnaya Sagar Press, and is characterised by broad proportions, generous counters, and strong diagonal strokes and terminals. The Marathi font favours traditional, vertical forms of many conjuncts as still found in Marathi literary publishing. For the Open Font License release, Tiro Devanagari Marathi has been extended to support additional characters, and features a new italic companion. Each font also includes a Latin subset including diacritics for transcription of Indian languages.

    Tiro Devanagari Marathi was designed by John Hudson and Fiona Ross. The italic was adapted by Paul Hanslow.
