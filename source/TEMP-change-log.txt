Tiro Indic fonts v1.60 CHANGE LOG


ALL FONTS
Changed vertical metrics model to avoid MS Word abd Libre Office clipping bugs reported in
https://github.com/TiroTypeworks/Indigo/issues/16
https://github.com/TiroTypeworks/Indigo/issues/17
The OS/2 sTypoAscender and sTypoDescender and corresponding hhea table ascender and descender values are now matched to the OS/2 usWinAscent and usWinDescent, and the OS/2 sTypoLineGap and hhea lineGap values are set to zero.

I hate doing this. It undermines the whole purpose of having separate OS/2 metrics sets for linespacing and for clipping. It renders the OS/2 and hhea linegap fields useless. But apparently giving text processing engineers a dedicated fsSelection bit to tell them to use sTypo metrics for linespacing doesnt stop them from exchanging one stupid mistake for another. So now, instead of erroneously using OS/2 usWin metrics for linespacing, they are erroneously using sTypo metrics for clipping.
